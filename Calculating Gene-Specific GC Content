# Calculating Gene-Specific GC Content

This document outlines the procedure for computing the GC content for each gene using Bash commands and bioinformatics tools such as `bedtools` and `awk`. The process involves extracting exon information from a GTF file, converting it to BED format, calculating GC content, and associating these values with gene IDs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `bedtools` is installed on your system and the necessary files (`Mus_musculus.GRCm39.104.gtf` and `Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa`) are available in your working directory. This script assumes a basic understanding of genomic file formats (GTF, BED) and Unix command-line processing.

## Script Explanation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract exons from the GTF file
awk '$3 == "exon"' Mus_musculus.GRCm39.104.gtf > exons.gtf

# Convert exon information to BED format
awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, $4-1, $5, $9}' exons.gtf > exons.bed

# Calculate GC content using bedtools
bedtools nuc -fi Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa -bed exons.bed > gc_content.txt

# Associate GC content with gene IDs
bedtools intersect -a gc_content.txt -b Mus_musculus.GRCm39.111.gtf -wa -wb > gc_with_gene_ids.txt

# Format the final output to include gene IDs with GC content
awk -F'\t' '{
  match($0, /gene_id "([^"]+)"/, arr);
  print $1, $2, $3, arr[1], $5, $6;
}' gc_with_gene_ids.txt > gc_content_with_gene_ids.txt
