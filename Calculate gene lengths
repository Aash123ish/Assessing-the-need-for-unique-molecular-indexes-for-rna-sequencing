# This script extracts gene lengths from a GTF file and outputs a TSV file with gene information.
# Ensure you have the GTF file named `Mus_musculus.GRCm39.111.gtf` in your current directory.

# Step 1: Extract relevant fields for genes
# Filters the GTF for gene entries, then extracts the chromosome, start and end positions,
# and gene IDs. This is the initial extraction using awk.
awk '$3 == "gene" {
  print $1, $4, $5, $10, $14, $16
}' Mus_musculus.GRCm39.111.gtf |

# Step 2: Clean up the output
# Uses sed to remove double quotes and semicolons from the output, which are common in GTF files.
sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/;//g' |

# Step 3: Calculate gene lengths and format the output
# Uses awk again to calculate gene length as end position minus start position plus one
# (to account for inclusive counting in genomic coordinates), and formats the output as a TSV.
awk '{
  OFS="\t";  # Set output field separator as tab
  print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, ($3-$2+1)
}' > gene_lengths.tsv

# Completion message
echo "Gene lengths extraction completed. Output saved to gene_lengths.tsv"
